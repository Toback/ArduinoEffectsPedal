# ArduinoEffectsPedal
Arduino Musical Effects Pedal. Example effects I was able to implement were delay, reverb, granular synthesis, and filtering via the Discrete Fourier Transform. Code for reverb and granular synthesis are provided. Main inspiration for this work comes from Amanda Ghassaei's Vocal Effects Box project found here: http://www.amandaghassaei.com/projects/arduinodsp/
